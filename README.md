# Factor Exchange
A Python implementation of the Tax Factor mini-game from Dr. Quandary.

The initial steps will be a solver that attempts to find the optimal strategy for single-player Tax Factor. After that is complete, a tablet-compatible app will be created with a variable number of players and cards.
